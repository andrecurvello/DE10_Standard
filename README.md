# DE10_Standard
Base project for technical review progress follow up.

The folder structure of this start up project is layed down as such :

- documents
- tools
- design
- src

The document folder shall group together all necessary material for good understanding
of the project.

The tool directory shall gather all utility scripts, widgets, external tools that may be used.

The design directory is essentially the place where all FPGA designs will be stored.

Finally, the source directory is the place where all C sources shall be kept.

In order to illustrate the capacities of the brand new kit generously provided by Terasic,
I have chosen to enhance the bitcoin mining project that I have been working on for quite
while.

This sketch illustrate the functional design of the project :
